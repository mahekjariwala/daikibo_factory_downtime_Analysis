# ðŸ“Š Daikibo Factory Machine Downtime Analysis

This project analyzes telemetry data from Daikiboâ€™s 4 factories to identify:
1. In which location did machines break the most?
2. Which machines broke most often in that location?

The analysis was performed using Tableau, based on a unified JSON telemetry dataset covering May 2021.
